## Resume Section Options

### Option 1: Personal Projects Section

```
AI-Powered Homelab Infrastructure | 2025
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Designed and deployed enterprise-grade infrastructure using AI coding agents
(Claude Code) as a force multiplier for rapid development and automation.

• Provisioned 18 VMs across 3-node Proxmox cluster using Terraform IaC
• Deployed 9-node Kubernetes cluster with automated Ansible playbooks
• Implemented full observability stack (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana)
• Built GitLab CI/CD pipelines for automated service onboarding
• Integrated 30+ containerized services with Traefik reverse proxy and SSO (Authentik)
• Maintained infrastructure-as-code with comprehensive documentation

Technologies: Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes, Docker, Proxmox, GitLab CI/CD,
             OpenTelemetry, Python, Claude Code (AI Agent)
```

### Option 2: Highlight AI Agent Collaboration

```
Infrastructure Automation with AI Agents | 2025
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Pioneered use of AI coding agents to accelerate homelab infrastructure
development, demonstrating human-AI collaboration for DevOps workflows.

• Leveraged Claude Code AI agent for infrastructure-as-code development,
  reducing deployment time by 10x compared to manual approaches
• Developed structured documentation and runbooks enabling AI agent
  to maintain context across 15+ documentation files
• Created automated troubleshooting workflows with AI-assisted debugging
• Built custom integrations (Discord bots, monitoring dashboards) through
  AI-assisted Python development
